# serializeXmiCpn
This is a minimal example of another project, created to make it easier to understand some errors that occur when using an Eclipse plugin (CPN Tools Toolkit) to serialize XMI-format CPN models into CPN Tools' ".cpn" format

Further instructions are found on the SimulationServiceService class (where the problematic code is found):
